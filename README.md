### Hi there! 😁👋

My name is Douglas Modesto, I coursed the System Analysis and Development Graduation at FATEC, I have a post-graduation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at FIAP and I'm coursing Distributed Software Arquitechture post-graduation at PUC Minas.

I love about technology, I have the domain in backend with C# and NodeJs languages and frontend with VueJs, React, and Angular.

Currently, I'm a tech leader and scrum master, and I work at Guide Investimentos. I have experience in Software Science with an emphasis in the development system and business agility with a focus on client

My goals are to learn the max I can and apply my knowledge where I can

In my free time, I like to listen to music (🎵), read books  (📚), watch movies  (📺), and I love to craft beers (🍺)
